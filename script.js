What's JavaScript?

'JavaScript is a structured interpreted programming language,
 high-level scripting with weak dynamic typing and multiparadigm. 
 Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main 
 technologies on the World Wide Web.
 It is currently the main language for client-side programming 
 in web browsers. It is also widely used on the server side 
 through environments such as node.js.
